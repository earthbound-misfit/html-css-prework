        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am a realtor living in Chicago making a career switch into software development. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For the last couple of years I have been dabbling with
            learning different aspects of technology to explore what I gravitate toward most. After exploring programming and computer networking and IT security, I have decided to pursue a career in software engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have always had a seemingly insatiable need to continue learning. In the past couple of years, I have been learning French, as well as how to make stained glass art and how to sew.
        </p>

        <p>
            Eventually I would like to use my programming skills for projects that promote social justice and work to empower underrepresented people in the tech industry.
